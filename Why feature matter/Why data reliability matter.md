You are trying to create a massive database of notes. It's a significant amount of work. With thousands of hours spent, it may become a life work. 

  

I assume that you didn't want to lose it. 

  

Companies come and go, but your notes should be available even when laptops will be replaced with Smart Glasses or Direct Neural Connection.

  

If you have all your notes locally on your hard drive with regular backups to some encrypted cloud storage — you are fine. But with SaaS, things got complicated:

  

# Let's talk about SaaS

  

I see here some potential problems: 

  

- SaaS can fail and shut down service

- SaaS can remove your account

- SaaS can be hacked

- SaaS can lose part of your data

  

  

# Fail and shutting down

  

Any company can die. It can run out of money. It can be bought by a big corporation, which may decide to shut it down (try to search for examples — it's a pretty typical scenario) 

  

And don't forget, with SaaS, all your data is stored on remote servers. If SaaS closed, they would shut down their servers, and you will lose access to your data. 

  

Why can they close? Let's lookup SaaS status on Jul 2021:

  

[[Clover]] — founded: 2020, beta, didn't support export, didn't have "about us" page, can't find information about financial status, Funding by YCombinator — it increases the probability that they didn't have a business model yet [link](https://www.ventureradar.com/organisation/Clover/b243e0a9-7148-4a09-9721-6ee7a26ef53c/)

  

[[Craft]] — founded: 2019, release: Nov 2020, raised $8M in ****April 2021**** [link](https://www.ventureradar.com/organisation/Craft%20Docs/3db70f9e-6523-4e69-a46b-83a37ed8b319)

  

[[HyperNotes]] — part of [ZenKit](https://zenkit.com) which owned by [Axonic](https://www.ventureradar.com/organisation/Axonic%20Informationssysteme/f43a0502-a758-4a49-b48c-a00939acdfa2/) — can't find any information about long-term plans. 

  

[[mem.ai]] — founded: 2014 (?), beta, raised $5.6M in **April 2021** [link](https://www.ventureradar.com/organisation/Mem/86447004-e106-41c0-8153-35fd9dbbfe22/)

  

[[Notion]] - founded in 2012, release in 2016, venture founded, current evaluation over $2Billion. 

  

[[Roam]] - founded in 2017, can't find any information about financial status [link](https://www.ventureradar.com/organisation/Roam%20Research/04d4a9f6-891d-496a-922e-ea74b9967813/)

  

[[SimpleNote]] - Free and not core service of [Automattic](https://www.ventureradar.com/organisation/Automattic/0070cace-8bbf-464d-b57a-fafc5f762f30/). They didn't have a public business model for now. 

  

## CloudKit and iCloud or Dropbox

  

Some of the standalone apps ([[NotePlan]], [[Apple Notes]], [[Bear]], [[iA Writer]]) uses Apple infrastructure. 

  

Right now, Apple is a well-doing company. A lot of apps in the App Store rely on CloudKit and iCloud. 

Apple can close it, or Apple can go bankrupt. But I'm not sure that happens in the next few years. 

  

On the other side, we can't predict the future.

  

**Highlight:** I'm appreciating how [[NotePlan]] deals with it — it supports CloudKit (as one of the storage options), but stores everything as plain markdown files, taking best value from both worlds. 

  

## In English, please!

  

The most reliable solution for SaaS is [[Notion]] — they have users and make money. I'm pretty sure they remain open in the next few years. 

  

[[Craft]] and [[Mem]] raised their first money in April 2021. It's a lottery now. I wish them success, but now their future it's not clear.

  

[[Clover]] is in beta and in YCombinator, so it's an even earlier stage compared to [[Craft]] and [[Mem]]

  

[[SimpleNote]] and [[HyperNotes]] are part of bigger corporation. SimpleNote is free (that means losing money), and [[HyperNotes]] doesn't look like a core product for ZenKit (probably, I don't know) — so any of this can be closed any moment

  

[[Roam]] is the only exception — I can't find information for raising money, so I assume they earn enough from subscription and their business model works. Still, that didn't mean that this model will works in the following years — while they still didn't have a mobile client, I'm not sure about their long-term future. 

  

Apps that use CloudKit relied on Apple infrastructure, so at least you will not lose your data while Apple exists. 

  

# Losing access to account

  

All SaaS companies try to tell you that your data is yours. That's not true.

  

Any of the SaaS can remove or block your account without any consequences. That means you will lose access to your life-long notes. 

  

I'm not saying it will happen, but there is a chance of it. And you are not in control here.

  

Try to search how often people relied on SaaS and got their accounts removed or blocked. It even happens to me with twitter — one of my accounts was blocked without the ability to restore. And I'm an average consumer without any unusual activities. 

  

# But I can export or backup my data...

  

Yes, you can. Please read [[Essential features#Data format and backups]]

  

# Conclusion

  

My recommendation: use SaaS only if it allows scheduled backups. In all other cases - use standalone apps which rely on iCloud, Dropbox, or CloudKit.
