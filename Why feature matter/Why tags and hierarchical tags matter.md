# Why tags matter

Let's imagine that you reading a book. You want to remember some quotes, leave your thoughts about ideas you have, and create a review. 

Obvious way is to create tags `#qutes`, `#books`, `#thoughts`, `#bookreview`

Alternative way is to create pages `[[quotes]]` and mention this pages in your note. 

But with tags you'll be able to build complex search queries like `Harry potter #quotes` and observe all quotes regarding to all Harry Potter books

# Why hierarchical tags matter
