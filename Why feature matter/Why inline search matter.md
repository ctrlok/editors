By default, Zettelkasten is a physical and straightforward system. If you want to link notes, find the reference and write on paper reference ID. It's pretty remarkable how it works without computers and modern tooling.

Without an inline search, you are forced to do that search by yourself. It may not seems critical, but it slows down your process. 

Based on my experience, fast processes are better than slow ones. Better because speed encouraging usage. The Fast methods are less avoidable than the Slow.

In Zettelkasten, you may want to link your note to more than a single place. And each iteration of referencing slowing you and encourages context loss.


# Example for developers: 

You typical user who has 1,000-10,000 notes. You want to use a new library in your project. You'll add text:
```
LibraryName is a new library for the Go language. I'm planning to use it in ProjectName because it's new and shiny.
```

Obviously, you want to link this note with notes `[[Golang language]]` and `[[ProjectName]]` 

Your process: 
1. go to search and lookup for 'Go language'
2. copy link to it
3. go to your note and paste this link
4. go to search and again lookup for 'ProjectName' note
5. go back and paste this link

# Example for non-developers
You typical user who has 1,000-10,000 notes. You want to go on vacation. Now you are looking up hotels in Spain. 

First, you'll need to create a note called 'Hotels in Spain' with text:

```
My therapist recommends a vacation. I want to go to Spain and live in a beautiful and luxurious hotel. Here is a list of hotels my boss recommends to me: 
```

Obviously you may want to link `[[vacation]]`, `[[Spain]]`, and maybe `[[hotels]]` , `[[BossName]]` and `[[therapy]]`

Your process:
1. go to search, found note 'vacation'
2. copy link
3. go back to your note and paste a link
4. go to search, found not 'Spain'
5. copy link
6. go back to your note and paste a link

Repeat the same for 'hotels', 'BossName' and 'therapy'.

# Conclusion

I tried to use [[editors/apps/Apple Notes]], [[The Archive]], and [[iA Writer]] and found that I'm trying to make only a single connection between notes instead of multiple. I did that because my brain is lazy. 
Then I tried to use tags, but a number of the tags become overwhelming instantly. 

After only 2-3 days of usage, I had around 50 notes and 60 tags, which became completely unusable. I can't imagine how anyone can reference anything with 1,000-10,000 notes.

I'm sure searching for references may become a fun activity. Someone definitely will appreciate it. But a regular person, like me, will lose context quicker than filling all necessary connections. 

Also, I read about backreferencing with a short description of each referenced note. It sounds interesting, but even with backreferencing, backline search is a great feature. It does not limit your flow but expands it with additional functionality.

My recommendation: use only apps with [[Essential features#Inline search]].
