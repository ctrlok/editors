Imagine big book. Like "War and Peace" or "Lord of the Rings". Imagine ten of them. 

Each book contains around 1,000 pages. 

Imagine ten pages of this book. Then do this again nine times — it's only one hugred pages. Scale this hungred to thouthand. Then to ten thouthand. 

It's impressive, but you'll have that much notes with Zettelkasten. 

And you will need somehow access all this information. And having a single entrypoint is enough — for book. This isn't book, this is a huge graph of information. 

My recommendation: don't use systems which didn't allow you to create as much entrypoints as you may need for 10,000 notes.
