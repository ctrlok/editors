While Zettelkasten is your knowledge base, you may want to:

- use data
- fill your Zettelkasten

And while your phone is always with you, without a mobile client for your Zettelkasten, you may want to add your thoughts immediately. 

Personally, I perform a lot of activities on the phone or iPad:

- book reading
- news reading
- watching videos
- taking photos

And a lot of this requires note-taking. Without a mobile app for note-taking, these activities will be separated from your Zettelkasten and require an additional buffer.

Another point of view: you may want to refer some of your knowledge when you have dinner with friends or important meetings. While you may not have your laptop with you, probably you'll have your phone. 

My recommendation: didn't use apps without mobile client.
