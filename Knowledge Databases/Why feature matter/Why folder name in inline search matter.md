First, check out [[Why folders or parents matter]]

Example:

Let's imagine that you have few projects and want to takes notes for those projects. For each project, you have a note called "Long-term plans."

And then you want to reference your "Long-term plans" for one of those projects in another note. That is what happens if you didn't have a folder name in search ([[NotePlan]] as an example):

![[folder-name-fail.jpg]]

The obvious solution — include the project name in the note name: "Long-term plans for Project1". 

But you already have this prefix — it's the folder name!
And solutions like [[Obsidian]] or [[Notion]] treats folder/page name as prefix and allows you to include folder name as part of your inline search request:

![[obsidian-dir.jpg]]

My recommendation: use a solution that supports folder/parent name in the inline search.
