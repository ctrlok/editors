# Why linked mentions matter
The core of Zettelkasten is navigation. 

The expected behavior is «jump to the entry point and navigate deeper to your web.» 

To achieve that, you have two options:

- manually create backlinks on parent pages
- mention parent from the current note and allow your software to create links instead of you

While you didn't have the entire structure of Zettelkasten in your mind, creating mentions note→parent is effortless. It didn't break the context of writing. And with it — better. 

# Why mentions should be observable on the same page with your note

It just encourages you to explore your Zettelkasten by showing you related topics. 

We are humans, and we are curious. Mechanism of showing related videos, music, news already used by big corporations. Why not use it for good — your Zettelkasten? 

My recommendation: don't use a system which not able to show mentions. And prefer software, which didn't require an additional click to observe references.
