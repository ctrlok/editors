While we talking about your knowledge base, you may want to:

- use data
- fill your base

And while your phone is always with you, you may want to add your thoughts immediately.

Personally, I perform a lot of activities on the phone or iPad:

- book reading
- news reading
- watching videos
- taking photos

A lot of them assumes note-taking. Without a mobile app for note-taking, these activities will be separated from your notes and will require an additional buffer.

Another point of view: you may want to refer some of your knowledge when you have dinner with friends or important meeting. While you may not have your laptop with you, probably you'll have your phone.

My recommendation: didn't use apps without mobile client.
