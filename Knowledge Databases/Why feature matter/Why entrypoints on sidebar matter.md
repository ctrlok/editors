Imagine a big book. Like "War and Peace" or "Lord of the Rings." Imagine ten of them. 

Each book contains around 1,000 pages. 

Imagine ten pages of this book. Then do this again nine times — it's only one hundred pages. Scale this to thousand. Then to ten thousand. 

It's impressive, but you'll have that many notes in your connected graph. 

And you will need to access all this information somehow. And having a single entry point is enough — for a book. But your notes aren't a book; it's a colossal graph of information. 

## Encyclopedia
Some of you may say, that wikipedia or britanica didn't have entry points — you are right. 

But did you know how much time editors spent on supporting? It's colossal amount of work of many people. Do you have resources like this? Or do you want to take a quick note when you have an idea and then find this note somehow? 


**My recommendation:** don't use systems that didn't allow you to create as many entry points as you may need for 10,000 notes.
