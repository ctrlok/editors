# Why privacy matter

Imagine you received an offer to store your diary — all your thoughts inside a library. 

The company, which owns the library, assures you that their employee will not read your diary. 

They can read it. They didn't have any obligations to you for not to read it. There is no way you can check they are reading your diary or not. Only a promise not to read it. 

Exactly the same thing happens when you store your notes in SaaS.


# But I want to keep my data in sync!

You can do this. 

But service should support **end-to-end encryption** — that means data should be encrypted on your computer and stored in SaaS in an encrypted state. 

Also, the company should pass **security audit** by an independent third-party security agency. 

Another option is to use an open-source product, which supports end-to-end encryption, and you (or someone) can read their encryption implementation. 

# What else can help me? 

If the company offers no end-to-end encryption, they should at least pass few independent security audits. 

Many agencies are doing this for financial apps, banks, governments, and medical apps — I see no reason not to do this for notes. 

# I trust the company, even I have no reason! 

Ok, you can trust the company. But what if this company gets hacked? 
Do you want anyone to sell your data in the darknet? 
Imagine a person with bad intentions gets access to your notes? 

# Conclusion

My recommendation: use a solution that implements end-to-end encryption **and** passed security audits. 

Or without e-to-e, but at least with passed security audits. 

Or solution that uses third-party storage (like iCloud or Dropbox)
