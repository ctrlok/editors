Fuzzy search using in software development for ages and makes referencing something more straightforward and faster. 

![[inline-fuzzy-search.mp4]]

Let me make an **example**:

I'm reading the second most outstanding book in the world: [«Harry Potter and methods of rationality»](http://www.hpmor.com) by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

While reading, I want to take some notes, paste some quotes and write my thoughts about it. 

I'm creating a note called `[[Harry potter and methods of rationality]]` 

From this moment, each time I want to mention this book or reference to it, I need to type `[[Harry` - and browsing all my reviews for all Harry Potters books and all my HPMoR fanfics I'll never finish, forced to press arrows to check correct book. 

With fuzzy search, I can write `[[harat` (**Har**ry potter and methods of **rat**ionality) and get correct link by pressing enter. 


This feature, with proper implementation, saves time and makes referencing funnier. 

My recommendation: try to choose a solution with fuzzy search or demand developers to introduce fuzzy search in their apps.
