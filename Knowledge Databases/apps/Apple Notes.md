It's a general note-taking solution from apple. 


**General purpose:** taking notes on the go with app that already on your iPhone/Mac. I added it to the list because of iOS 15 tag support.

**Knowledge graph:** nope. Because major issues in [[Essential features#Linking notes]] and [[Essential features#Navigation]]. Only in combination with other software. 

## Minor features

### Quick notes
iPadOS 15/macOS Monterey introduces "Quick notes" — ability to take a note from any place. 
Still, it can be partially replaced by [[Hook]]. 

TODO

### Sharing
Notes and Folders can be shared with other [[Apple Notes]] users — means with anyone who own Mac or iPhone. 

### Protecting notes with password
Notes can be protected with password. 

### Tasks
Supports tasks creation, still, without ability to review or group tasks. 

### Tables
Support tables.
