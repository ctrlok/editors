Conclusion: as you can see, only [[NotePlan]] and [[Obsidian]] didn't have major issues. All other apps has major issues in essential requirements. 

That may be not an issue for you, but I recommend to read document down bellow, and "why it's matter" links under each section. 

---

# Linking notes
In app you should be able to create links to other notes. Because links it's a core of Zettelkasten. 

## Creating references
General behaviour — create links via `[` symbol and create new page if it didn't exist. 

✅ Supported apps: [[Obsidian]], [[Notion]], [[NotePlan]], [[HyperNotes]], [[The Archive]], [[Craft]], [[Roam]], [[Logseq]], [[Clover]], [[Bear]]

🤔 [[iA Writer]] and [[SimpleNote]] supports only markdown link style (like `[name](app://)`)

🤔 [[Mem]] supports links creation via `+` 

👎 And [[Apple Notes]] supports link creation only via [[Hook]]

## Inline search
App should provide inline search through notes after typing `[[` or `[` or `+` 
Example: 
![[zettel-inline-search.mp4]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why inline search matter]]

**✅ Supported apps:** [[Bear]], [[Clover]], [[Craft]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Logseq]], [[Mem]], [[Notion]], [[NotePlan]], [[Obsidian]], [[Roam]], [[SimpleNote]]

🚫 🙅‍♂️ Apps that **didn't support** inline search: [[Apple Notes]], [[iA Writer]] and [[The Archive]]

### Fuzzy inline search
Approximate search by symbols between different words in the note name. Example:
![[inline-fuzzy-search.mp4]]
⭐️ **Supported by** [[Obsidian]], [[Roam]], [[Craft]], [[NotePlan]] and [[Clover]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why fuzzy search matter]]


### Folder name in inline search

![[obsidian-dir.jpg]]

⭐️ [[Obsidian]], [[Notion]] and [[Clover]] **support** showing floder/parrent name in inline search. 

🤔 [[Craft]] and [[NotePlan]] **didn't support** it

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why folder Name in inline search matter]]


# Navigation

## Showing linked references
App should be able to show all pages that mention current page. 

![](/post/zettelkasten-soft/references.jpg)

✅ Showing on the **same page**: [[Obsidian]], [[NotePlan]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Craft]], [[Mem]], [[Roam]] and [[Logseq]]

🤔 App **requires you to click** to observe references: [[Notion]], [[Clover]], [[SimpleNote]]

🚫 🙅‍♂️ App that **didn't support** list of mentions: [[Bear]], [[Apple Notes]], [[The Archive]], [[iA Writer]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why showing linked mentions matter]]

## Tags
App should support tags. Hierarchical tags are better than plain. 

![[tags.jpg]]

✅ ⭐️ Apps that supports hierarchical tags: [[Bear]], [[Obsidian]], [[NotePlan]]

✅ Apps that supports non-hierarchical tags: [[Apple Notes]], [[iA Writer]], [[Mem]], [[SimpleNote]], [[The Archive]]

🚫 Apps that didn't support tags: [[Craft]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Logseq]], [[Clover]], [[Roam]] and [[Notion]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why tags and hierarchical tags matter]]

### Tags as search paramether
Apps should provide ability of specify search request with tags:

![[tag-search.jpg]]

✅ Apps that supports tags as a search paramether: [[Apple Notes]], [[iA Writer]], [[Bear]], [[Obsidian]]

👎 Apps that didn't support tags as a search paramether: [[Mem]], [[NotePlan]], [[Roam]], [[SimpleNote]]

And I don't know about [[The Archive]] — they have complex search language, so probably they support it, but it's not native how. 

## Entrypoints on sidebar
Apps shoud allow you to pin notes, that will be your entry points, to sidebar

✅ Apps that supports it: [[Clover]], [[HyperNotes]], [[iA Writer]], [[Logseq]], [[Mem]], [[Roam]], [[NotePlan]], [[Obsidian]]

🤔 Supports somehow: [[Craft]],  [[Notion]], [[The Archive]]

🚫 Apps that didn't support it: [[Apple Notes]], [[Bear]], [[SimpleNote]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why entrypoints on sidebar matter]]

# Expirience

## Native vs Electron
App should have native client for macOS 

✅ Native applications: [[Apple Notes]], [[Bear]], [[Craft]], [[iA Writer]], [[NotePlan]], [[SimpleNote]], [[The Archive]]

👎 Electron applications: [[Clover]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Logseq]], [[Mem]], [[Notion]], [[Obsidian]], [[Roam]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why native matter]]

## Mobile 
App should have native mobile client. 

✅ Native mobile clients: [[Apple Notes]], [[NotePlan]], [[Bear]], [[Craft]], [[iA Writer]]

👎 Not native mobile clients: [[Notion]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Obsidian]]

🚫 Apps without mobile client: [[Mem]], [[Roam]], [[Logseq]], [[The Archive]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why mobile client matter]]

# Long term access and data ownership
App should help you to create and observe. You should own your data.

## Data privacy

You data should be accessible only by you. Please, read [[Privacy check]] first:

✅ Working without involving clouds: [[Craft]](in local mode), [[iA Writer]] (in local mode), [[Logseq]], [[NotePlan]] (in local mode), [[Obsidian]] (in local mode), [[The Archive]]

✅ CloudKit: [[Apple Notes]], [[Bear]], [[NotePlan]]

🤔 iCloud/Dropbox sync: [[iA Writer]], [[NotePlan]]

🤔 SaaS (passed secutiry audits): [[Notion]]

🙅‍🚫 SaaS (didn't find info about audits): [[Clover]], [[Craft]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Mem]], [[Obsidian#Sync]], [[Roam]], [[SimpleNote]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why privacy matter]]

## Data reliability
App should be able to work in standalone mode with data stored on your disk

✅ Standalone: [[NotePlan]], [[Craft]] (standalone), [[iA Writer]], [[Logseq]], [[Obsidian]], [[The Archive]]

✅ CloudKit: [[Apple Notes]], [[Bear]], [[NotePlan]]

🚫 SaaS: [[Craft]], [[HyperNotes]], [[Mem]], [[Notion]], [[SimpleNote]], [[Roam]], [[Clover]]

Here is more info why it's matter: [[Why data reliability matter]]


## Data format and backups
App should operate with local markdown files or allows regular backups to markdown.  

Local files:

- ✅ markdown files:
	- ✅ wiki links (`[[ ]]`) [[Obsidian]], [[NotePlan]], [[The Archive]]
	- ✅ 🤔 markdown links (`[]()`): [[iA Writer]]
- 🤔 custom markdown files: [[Logseq]]
- 🤔 custom json files: [[Craft]]

Not local files:

- ✅ Implemented regular backups to third-party in mardkown format: [[Roam]]
- 🤔 Allow manual export in markdown:
	- 🤔 wiki links (`[[ ]]`): [[Bear]], [[Craft]], [[Notion]]
	- 👎 markdown/custom links: [[SimpleNote]]
- 👎 Not allow export in markdown, but:
	- 🚫 only as PDF: [[Apple Notes]]
	- 👎 custom JSON: [[HyperNotes]], [[Mem]]
- 🚫 🙅‍♂️ Didn't have export option: [[Clover]]
